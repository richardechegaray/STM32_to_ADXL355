# STM32_to_ADXL355
Program featuring SPI communication (ST MCU to ADXL355 eval board), used to measure tilt with a precision of +/- 0.002 degrees

# Things to note
- This code was built using Atollic TrueSTUDIO, and STM32CubeMX
- Some methods for the ADXL355 eval board were adapted from Analog Devices' GitHub: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP360/tree/master/projects/ADuCM360_demo_adxl355_pmdz
